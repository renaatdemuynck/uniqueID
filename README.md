# uniqueID shim

Internet Explorer has a property called `uniqueID` that generates a unique id. This shim provides the same functionality to other browsers.

## The `uniqueID` property

Retrieves an autogenerated, unique identifier for the object.

### Syntax

```javascript
var id = object.uniqueID
```

### Remarks

When you apply this property to the document object, the client automatically generates a new ID that you can assign to an element's id property.

A new ID is generated and assigned to the element the first time the property is retrieved. Every subsequent access to the property on the same element returns the same ID.

**Note** The unique ID generated is not guaranteed to be the same every time the document is loaded.
